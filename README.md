#Mnemonic 'improving memory' process of stories to rember.

#a + b = M.
#a XOR b = N.

#This problem was asked by Facebook.

#In chess, the Elo rating system is used to calculate player strengths based on game results.

#A simplified description of the Elo system is as follows. Every player begins at the same score. For each subsequent game, the loser transfers some points to the #winner, where the amount of points transferred depends on how unlikely the win is. For example, a 1200-ranked player should gain much more points for beating a 2000-#ranked player than for beating a 1300-ranked player.

#Implement this system.
